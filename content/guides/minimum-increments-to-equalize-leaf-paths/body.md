## Bottom-up

1. best[leaf] = cost[leaf].
2. For a node u with children: m = max best[c]; add 1 for every child c with best[c] < m; best[u] = cost[u] + m.
3. Answer the total.

Examples → 1, 0, 1. Checked against trying every set of increased nodes on 500 random trees.

Increasing leaves instead (count leaves below the maximum path): example 3 → 2 instead of 1.
