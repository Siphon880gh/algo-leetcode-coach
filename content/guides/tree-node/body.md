## Root, then Inner, then Leaf

```sql
SELECT id,
    CASE
        WHEN p_id IS NULL THEN 'Root'
        WHEN id IN (SELECT p_id FROM Tree) THEN 'Inner'
        ELSE 'Leaf'
    END AS type
FROM Tree;
```

The root check must come first: a root with children is also someone's parent, but its type is `Root`. A self `LEFT JOIN Tree AS c ON c.p_id = t.id` with `COUNT(c.id) > 0` also detects inner nodes.

Do not write `id NOT IN (SELECT p_id FROM Tree)` to find leaves; the root's `p_id` is `NULL`, so that subquery contains a `NULL` and the test is never true. Do not label a single-node tree Leaf; it is `Root`.
