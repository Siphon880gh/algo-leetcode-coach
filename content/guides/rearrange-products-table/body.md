## Unpivot

```sql
SELECT product_id, 'store1' AS store, store1 AS price FROM Products WHERE store1 IS NOT NULL
UNION ALL
SELECT product_id, 'store2', store2 FROM Products WHERE store2 IS NOT NULL
UNION ALL
SELECT product_id, 'store3', store3 FROM Products WHERE store3 IS NOT NULL
```

Example → five rows; product 1 has no store2 row.

Filter with `IS NOT NULL`; `<> NULL` is never true. `UNION ALL` avoids a needless duplicate-removal pass.
