## All pairs, then counts

```sql
SELECT s.student_id, s.student_name, sub.subject_name,
       COUNT(e.student_id) AS attended_exams
FROM Students s
CROSS JOIN Subjects sub
LEFT JOIN Examinations e
  ON e.student_id = s.student_id AND e.subject_name = sub.subject_name
GROUP BY s.student_id, s.student_name, sub.subject_name
ORDER BY s.student_id, sub.subject_name;
```

In the example, Alice has Math 3, Physics 2, Programming 1; Alex has 0 for all three subjects.

Do not use `COUNT(*)`; it counts the unmatched row as 1. Do not start from Examinations; students with no exams would vanish.

Time: O(students · subjects + exams)  
Space: O(students · subjects)
