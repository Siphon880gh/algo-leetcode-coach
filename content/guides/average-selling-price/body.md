## Weighted average

```sql
SELECT p.product_id,
       IFNULL(ROUND(SUM(p.price * u.units) / SUM(u.units), 2), 0) AS average_price
FROM Prices p
LEFT JOIN UnitsSold u
  ON u.product_id = p.product_id
 AND u.purchase_date BETWEEN p.start_date AND p.end_date
GROUP BY p.product_id;
```

Example: product 1 → (100 · 5 + 15 · 20) / 115 = 6.96.

Do not average the prices; weight them by units. Do not use an inner join; products with no sales must show 0. Put the date range in the `ON` clause for the same reason.

Time: O(n log n)  
Space: O(products)
