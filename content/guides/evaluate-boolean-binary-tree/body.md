## Children first

1. If `node` is a leaf, return `node.val = 1`.
2. `l, r` = evaluate both children.
3. Return `l OR r` if `node.val = 2`, else `l AND r`.

Examples → true, false.

The tree is full, so every non-leaf has two children and no null checks are needed inside. Short-circuiting the second child is fine, since evaluation has no side effects.
